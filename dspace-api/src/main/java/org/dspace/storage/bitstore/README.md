Dryad Storage
==============

This directory combines the old (DSpace 1.7) bitstream storage manager with the current version (DSpace 6.0). 

BitstreamStorageManager.java -- the original version, which is being phased out

Everything else is from the current DSpace.

I decided to do this in the "real" directory rather than the modules directory for clarity. It seems easier to be certain what code is being used this way.
