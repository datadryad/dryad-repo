      <p>Dryad frees journals and publishers from the responsibility and costs of publishing and
      maintaining supplemental data in perpetuity.  By encouraging transparency and making possible a
      broad range of research and educational reuse, journals and publishers increase their impact and
      reputation.</p> 
      <p>Journal publishers are encouraged to facilitate data archiving by
      coordinating the submission of manuscripts with submission of data to Dryad.  Dryad communicates
      in a lightweight and flexible way with most online manuscript processing systems.</p>
      <p>Advantages of Submission Integration include:</p>
     <ul class="text-list">
      <li>Simplifying the process of data submission for authors.</li>
      <li>Allowing authors to deposit, to a single repository, gigabytes of data files in their original formats.</li>
      <li>Reducing the rate of noncompliance with journal data policy.</li>
      <li>The option of making data available during peer review, via secure access for editors and reviewers.</li>
      <li>Ensuring bidirectional links between the article and the data prior to publication.</li>
      <li>Ensuring that the Dryad record can be accessed at the time of online article publication.</li>
    <li>Giving authors the option to delay release of data for a fixed period after article publication,
      if consistent with journal policy; editors may authorize custom-length data embargoes.</li>
    <li>Enhancing visibility of the article via linking from the independently discoverable data files</li>
     </ul>
      <p>We welcome Submission Integration for any organization that publishes a scientific journal
      irrespective of whether the organization is signed up for a payment plan or is a member of Dryad.
      Please contact <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> for more
      information.</p>
