     <p>Submission Integration is a free service that allows journal
     publishers to coordinate the submission of manuscripts with submission
     of data to Dryad. Benefits:</p>

     <ul class="text-list" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
         <li>Simplify the process of data submission for authors.</li>
         <li>Allow authors to deposit, to a single repository, gigabytes of data files in their original formats.</li>
         <li>Reduce the rate of noncompliance with journal data policy.</li>
         <li>Have the option of making data available for editorial or peer review, via secure access for editors and reviewers.</li>
         <li>Ensure bidirectional links between the article and the data and increased visibility for both.</li>
         <li>Ensure that the data is accessible once the article becomes available online.</li>
         <li>Give authors the option to embargo public access to data for a limited time after publication, if permitted by the journal's data policy.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>We welcome Submission Integration for any organization that publishes a
     scientific journal irrespective of whether the organization is signed up
     for a payment plan or is a member of Dryad. The submission integration
     process works with many different online manuscript processing systems. It
     is lightweight and customizable to each journal's needs. Please contact 
     <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> for
