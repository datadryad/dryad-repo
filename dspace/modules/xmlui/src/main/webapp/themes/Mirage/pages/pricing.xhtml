     <p class="deposit-fees">Dryad will begin charging deposit fees on the 1st of September 2013.</p>
     <p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term
      access</strong> to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students,
      irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to
      data due to financial support from members and data depositors.  Dryadâ€™s fee structure is designed
      to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data.  New
      innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors.</p>
     <p>Publishing organizations may work with Dryad to provide a valuable service to their authors:
      allowing them to deposit data without paying a deposit fee at the time of submission.  To do this,
      Dryad offers a variety of flexible payment plans for journals and publishers, all of which provide a
      volume discount.  If no payment plan is in place, authors must pay a deposit fee at the time of
      submission, with the exception of researchers from developing countries, who may deposit data at no
      charge.   Please contact director@datadryad.org to discuss which payment plan would be most suitable
      for your journal or journals</p>

     <h2>Payment Plan 1: Subscription</h2>
      <p>An unlimited number of deposits are allowed from a journal (or journals) with an active
      Subscription Plan. The subscription fee is calculated based on the total number of research articles
      published by the journal(s) in the prior year, with a base fee of $25 per research article for
      members and $30 for non-members.  The minimum contract duration is two years, which can start at any
      time. Submission Integration is required for subscribing journal.  Excess storage fees for large
      data packages (see below) are charged to the depositor at the time of submission.</p>

      <h2>Payment Plan 2: Deferred Payment</h2>
      <p>Under the Deferred Payment Plan, fees are invoiced for the number of data packages deposited in
      the previous quarter.  The base fee is $70 per data package for members and $75 for non-members.
      Organizations must enter into a contract of at least one-year duration and may cap the number of
      deposits for which they are charged. Additional fees for submission integration, excess storage, or
      curation may be either counted against the account or charged to the depositor at the time of
      submission.</p>

      <h2>Payment Plan 3: Vouchers</h2>
      <p>Organizations may purchase a block of vouchers for future deposits at a base fee of $65 per data
      package for members and $70 for non-members.  The minimum purchase is 25 vouchers. Should the other
      fees listed below apply to an individual deposit, the organization has the option of charging the
      fees against the account or charging them to the depositor at the time of submission.</p>


      <h2>For individuals: Pay on Deposit</h2>
      <p>If none of the above payment plans is applicable to a given deposit, a base fee of $80 is
      charged, payable by the depositor at the time of submission.   <strong>Waivers</strong> are granted
      upon request for deposits originating from researchers based in <a
      href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">countries
      classified by the World Bank as Low-income or Lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>

      <p>While base deposit fees cover the entire cost of most submissions, two additional fees may apply:</p>
      <h2>Excess data storage:</h2>
      <p>For data packages in excess of the 10 GB size limit, a fee will be charged of $15 for the first
      GB and $10 for each additional GB or part thereof to cover the additional storage needs.</p>
      <h2>Non-integrated submission</h2>
      <p>For deposits from journals without integrated submission, a fee of $10 will be charged to cover
      the additional manual curation required.</p>
