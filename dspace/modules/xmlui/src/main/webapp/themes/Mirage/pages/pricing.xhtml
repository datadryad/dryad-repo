     to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of

     financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad’s <abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s are designed to 
     sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data. New 
     innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors.</p>

      <p>Organizations (including publishers, scientific societies, libraries, funders, and others) are 
      encouraged to cover the costs of <abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s on behalf of their community of researchers. For 
      instance, a society or publisher may cover the costs for all the authors of its journals. To do 
      this, Dryad offers a variety of flexible payment plans that provide for volume discounts. If no 
      payment plan is in place, authors must pay the DPC when their data is accepted by Dryad. Researchers 
      from economically developing countries may submit data at no charge.  
      Please contact <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> to
      discuss which payment plan would be most suitable for your organization.</p>

      <h2>Plan 1: Voucher Plan</h2>
      <p>Organizations are invited to purchase a block of vouchers for future submissions at a base charge of 
      <span class="msg-memberDPC_voucher">$65</span> per data package for members and <span class="msg-nonMemberDPC_voucher">$70</span> for non-members. The minimum purchase is 25 vouchers.  This plan is open to any organization.</p>

      <h2>Plan 2: Deferred Payment</h2>
      <p>Under the Deferred Payment Plan, <abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s are invoiced for the number of
      packages submitted in the previous quarter. The base charge is <span class="msg-memberDPC_deferred">$70</span> per data package for members and 
      <span class="msg-nonMemberDPC_deferred">$75</span> for non-members. Participants must enter into a contract of at least one-year 
      duration and may cap the number of submissions for which they are charged. This plan is open to publishers, publishing societies and independent journals.</p>

      <h2>Plan 3: Subscription</h2>
      <p>A journal (or journals) with an active Subscription Plan may make an unlimited number of submissions 
      for a fixed cost. This cost is calculated based on the total number of research articles
      published by the journal(s) in the prior year, with a base charge of <span class="msg-memberDPC_subscription">$25</span> per research article for
      members and <span class="msg-nonMemberDPC_subscription">$30</span> for non-members. The minimum contract duration is two years, which can start at any
      time. Submission Integration is required for subscribing journals.</p>

      <h2>For individuals:</h2>
      <p><a href="http://datadryad.org/pages/integratedJournals">Look up your journal</a> to see if it is covered by a payment plan or determine the cost if it is not covered. <strong>Waivers</strong> are granted
      upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in <a
      href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups" target="_blank">countries
      classified by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Pricing Plan Comparison Tool</h2>
      <p>Use our online <a href="/pages/pricingPlanComparisonTool">Pricing Plan Comparison Tool</a> to compare the annual cost of Dryad's pricing plans for
       members and non-members.</p>

      </table>

      <p>While base <abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s cover the entire cost of most submissions, two additional charges may apply.</p>

      <h2 id="excess-data-storage">Excess data storage</h2>
      <p>For data packages in excess of the 10 GB size limit, <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_first_GB">$15</span> will be charged for the first
      GB and <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_per_additional_GB">$10</span> for each additional GB or part thereof, payable by the submitter.</p>

      <h2>Non-integrated submission</h2>
      <p>For data from journals without <a href="/pages/integratedJournals">integrated submission</a>, an additional <span class="msg-notIntegratedJournalFee">$10</span> will be charged to individual
      submitters payable at the time of submission, to cover added curation costs.</p>
