     <h2 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Dryad will begin charging submission fees on the <span style="color: #40841c;">1st of September 2013</span>.</h2>
     <p>For membership dues, see <a href="/pages/membershipOverview#becomeAMember">Become a member</a></p>

     <p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term
      access</strong> to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students,
      irrespective of nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to
      data due to financial support from members and data submitters. Dryad's submission fees are designed 
      to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving data. New 
      innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors.</p>

      <p>Organizations (including publishers, scientific societies, libraries, funders, and others) are 
      encouraged to cover the costs of submission fees on behalf of their community of researchers. For 
      instance, a society or publisher may cover the costs for all the authors of its journals. To do 
      this, Dryad offers a variety of flexible payment plans that provide for volume discounts. If no 
      payment plan is in place, authors must pay a submission fee at the time of submission, with the exception 
      of researchers from economically developing countries, who may submit data at no charge.  
      Please contact <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> to
      discuss which payment plan would be most suitable for your journal or journals</p>

     <h1 class="ds-div-head" style="font-size: 150%; color: #40841c; margin-bottom: 10px;">Payment Plans</h1>

      <h2>Plan 1: Subscription</h2>
      <p>An unlimited number of submissions are allowed from a journal (or journals) with an active
      Subscription Plan. The subscription fee is calculated based on the total number of research articles
      published by the journal(s) in the prior year, with a base fee of USD$25 per research article for
      members and USD$30 for non-members. The minimum contract duration is two years, which can start at any
      time. Submission Integration is required for subscribing journals.</p>

      <h2>Plan 2: Deferred Payment</h2>
      <p>Under the Deferred Payment Plan, fees are invoiced to a journal or journals for the number of data 
      packages submitted in the previous quarter. The base fee is USD$70 per data package for members and 
      USD$75 for non-members. Publishing organizations must enter into a contract of at least one-year 
      duration and may cap the number of submissions for which they are charged.</p>

      <h2>Plan 3: Voucher Plan</h2>
      <p>An organization may purchase a block of vouchers for future submissions at a base fee of USD$65 per data
      package for members and USD$70 for non-members. The minimum purchase is 25 vouchers. This plan is 
      available to both publishing and non-publishing organizations.</p>

      <h2>For individuals: Pay on Submission</h2>
      <p>If none of the above payment plans is applicable to a given submission, a base fee of USD$80 is
      charged, payable by the submitter at the time of submission. <strong>Waivers</strong> are granted
      upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in <a
      href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">countries
      classified by the World Bank as Low-income or Lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>

      <table class="pricing-table">
          <thead>
              <tr><th>Payment Plan</th><th>Member</th><th>Non-member</th><th>Minimum purchase</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr class="odd"><td class="plan-name">1. Subscription Plan</td><td>annual fee based on USD$25 per published research article</td><td>annual fee based on USD$30 per published research article</td><td>2 yr contract</td></tr>

          </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>While base submission fees cover the entire cost of most submissions, two additional fees may apply.</p>

      <h2>Excess data storage fee</h2>
      <p>For data packages in excess of the 10 GB size limit, USD$15 will be charged for the first
      GB and USD$10 for each additional GB or part thereof, payable by the submitter at the time of submission.</p>

      <h2>Non-integrated submission fee</h2>
      <p>A fee of USD$10 will be charged for a submission from a non-integrated journal to cover added curation 
      costs. The fee is paid at the time of submission.</p>
