<p>The <strong>Dryad Digital Repository </strong>is a curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific
and medical publications discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide
diversity of datatypes. Dryad is governed by a nonprofit membership organization. Membership is open to diverse 
stakeholder organizations including scientific societies, publishers, research libraries, and funding organizations.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dataverse Network</strong> is an open source application to publish, share, cite, extract and analyze research data.
It facilitates making data available to others, and allows you to replicate others work. Researchers, data authors,
