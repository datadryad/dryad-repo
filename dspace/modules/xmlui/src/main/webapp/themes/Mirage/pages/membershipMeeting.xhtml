    <p>The symposium will provide an overview of the current landscape, interrogate the apparent benefits for researchers and research more generally and examine visions of the future of data publication. Above all, what sort of data publication will most engage researchers and most benefit research? The day will feature keynote presentations and panel sessions addressing key themes around data publication.   <a href="http://dryad-orcid-nfdp.eventbrite.co.uk/">Register here</a></p>

    <h2><a href="http://about.orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013">Joint Dryad-ORCID Symposium on Research Attribution, 23 May 2013</a></h2>
    <p>While it seems that digitized scholarship should lead the way to better discoverability and attribution, the age-old problems still plague us: confusion about names, siloed data, and a variety of cultural and technical obstacles.  This meeting, hosted jointly by Dryad and ORCID, provides a venue to discuss these issues and learn about the initiatives underway to address them, with attention to both the cultural and technical usage of persistent identifiers for researchers and their work. <a href="http://dryad-orcid-nfdp.eventbrite.co.uk/">Register here</a></p>
