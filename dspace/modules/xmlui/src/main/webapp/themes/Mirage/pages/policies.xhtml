<p>
The scientific, educational, and charitable <strong>mission</strong> of Dryad is to promote the availability of data underlying findings in the scientific literature for research and educational reuse.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>vision</strong> of Dryad is a scholarly communication system in which learned societies, publishers, institutions of research and education, funding bodies and other stakeholders collaboratively sustain and promote the preservation and reuse of data underlying the scholarly literature.
</p>

<p>
As a scientific data repository and a service for authors, researchers, journals, societies and publishers, Dryad aims to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>make scientific data available and usable for research, </li>
	<li>meet the needs of its stakeholders for a trustworthy common data repository,</li>
	<li>enable scientific data files to be indexed and findable,</li>
	<li>assign and provide DOIs for data files in the repository,</li>
	<li>track the usage of data files, and make this information available,</li>
	<li>allow and enforce data embargoes, in keeping with journal policy, and</li>
	<li>ensure that the service is widely and consistently available.</li>
</ul>
<p />
<p>
The following <strong>Terms of Service</strong> apply to those who contribute content ("Submitters") to the Dryad Digital Repository and to those who use the content (“Users”).  These terms apply with equal force to those who contribute or acquire content through the web interface or an application programming interface. The owner of <a href="http://datadryad.org">datadryad.org</a> (the “Site”) is referred to herein as "We" or "Dryad." 
</p>
<h2>1.	Site Content 
</h2>
<p>
Dryad is an international repository of data underlying peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature, particularly data for which no specialized repository exists. The content is considered to be integral to the published research.
</p>

<p>
All material in Dryad is associated with a scholarly publication. Most data in the repository are associated with peer-reviewed articles, although data associated with non-peer reviewed publications from reputable academic sources, such as dissertations, are also accepted.
</p>

<p>
For data that are within the scope of another repository, Dryad may make the data available to the secondary repository while retaining a copy, or Dryad may simply provide a mechanism for researchers to place data in the secondary repository.
</p>

<p>
Materials other than data may also be submitted to Dryad, depending on publisher policy, and provided the material can be released to the public domain. This includes software code in cases where a public software repository with version control is not deemed to be suitable by the author(s).
</p>

<p>
Ordinarily, no more than 10GB of material are submitted for a single publication, but special accommodations can be made for larger submissions.
</p>

<p>
All content is made available in the public domain under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver</a>, which reduces legal and technical impediments to reuse by waiving copyright and related rights to the extent permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
All Dryad submissions must be in English; Dryad curators cannot effectively review or curate submissions in other languages at this time. 
</p>

<h2>2.	Service availability</h2>

<p>
Dryad will make all reasonable efforts to maintain continuity of service and provide adequate warning of any changes or discontinuities. However, Dryad cannot accept responsibility for the consequences of any discontinuity in service.
</p>

<h2>3.	Permitted uses</h2> 

<dl class="formatted">
  <dt>a. User-submitted files and metadata</dt>
  <dd>  Unless otherwise indicated, all files and metadata submitted to Dryad are available in the public domain to the extent allowable by law through a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver. A small number of legacy files are available under other licensing terms. Users are expected to follow scholarly conventions for citation of the published article and its associated data, as described here.</dd>

  </dd>
  <dt>c.	Logos, screenshots and names</dt><dd>Individuals and organizations are welcome to use screenshots from the repository and other trademarks (such as logos) for informational purposes.

</dl>

<h2>4.	Prohibited uses</h2>
<p>
Submitters are expected to take due care to ensure that files do not contain content subject to pre-existing intellectual property restrictions or sensitive data, whether defined by law or by community ethical norms (e.g. personal medical records, locations of endangered species).
</p>
  

<p>
Users agree not to: use Dryad in any unlawful manner; use Dryad in any manner that would impair Dryad’s service to others or compromise system security; falsely misrepresent another person to Dryad; submit content that contains malicious software; exceed reasonable volumes of use. 
</p>

<p>
Dryad reserves the right to suspend the account of users in violation of these terms. 
</p>


<h2>5.	Expressions of concern, retractions, and removal of data files </h2>

<p>
Dryad defers authority to journals when issues arise regarding validity of the data. If content in Dryad is associated with an article for which there is an ‘expression of concern’ or a ‘retraction,’ Dryad will continue to make the content available, but with an appropriate warning and a link to the statement from the article’s publisher. Data files that are updated as corrections to the original paper will be similarly linked to the publisher’s corrigendum where Dryad receives notices of such.  
</p>

<p>
If data files or other materials are found, either before or after publication, to contain sensitive information or other prohibited content, the relevant material will be rejected or removed.
</p>

<p>
Those who wish to see content in the repository taken down, either for copyright infringement or other legitimate cause, should contact <a href="mailto:curator@datadryad.org">curator@datadryad.org</a> providing the following:
</p>

<ol class="formatted">
  <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>
  <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.</li>
  <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>
  <li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
  <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>6.	Record keeping and privacy policy</h2>
<p>
For planning and scientific review purposes, Dryad will keep records of usage. Dryad makes available information about aggregate usage of data packages and individual files.  Logs of usage may also be maintained for the purposes of monitoring and improving services, or measuring the impact a particular function has on our resources. These logs may be made available, after anonymization, to third parties.  For more information, see Dryad’s Privacy Policy. (Coming soon.)

Any feedback on services and software provided by Dryad will be treated as non-confidential unless the individual or organization providing the feedback states otherwise.
