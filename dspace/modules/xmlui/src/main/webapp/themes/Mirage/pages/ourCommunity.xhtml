      <p>Data are the foundation of the scientific enterprise.  By preserving and making available the
      data underlying the scientific and medical literature, Dryad provides benefits both to individual
      researchers, educators and students and to a diversity of stakeholder organizations.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Researchers:</strong></em> Dryad benefits researchers by providing free access to data 
      they can use for a host of different purposes: to study and validate published results, for methodology 
      development, for meta-analyses, and to address novel questions using historic observations.  Depositing
      in Dryad helps researchers get more credit for their work by increasing the usability and citability of 
      their data.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Educators and students:</strong></em> Dryad provides educators and students with the
      opportunity to teach and learn a broad array of analysis techniques, and general data literacy
      skills, using both classic and recently published research data.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Scientific societies:</strong></em> Archiving data in Dryad strengthens the legacy of
      a scientific society by permanently preserving the data and increasing the research impact of its
      members and community.  The availability of data creates new opportunities for research and
      education and promotes public trust in science.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Journals and publishers:</strong></em> Dryad frees journals and publishers from the
      responsibility and costs of publishing and maintaining supplemental data in perpetuity.  By
      encouraging a broader range of reuse, journals and publishers will increase the impact, citations
      and the prestige of their publications.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Research institutes and libraries:</strong></em> Dryad provides institutions with a
      new method their researchers can use to showcase their work.  It provides infrastructure for the
      preservation and dissemination of research data collected at the institution, as well as data from
      other institutions of value to its patrons.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Research funding organizations:</strong></em> Dryad provides a cost-effective
      mechanism for free, long-term access to data which, in turn, enables new research.  Data
      availability improves the rigor of the scientific record and public trust in the scientific
      enterprise.</p>
