    <h2 id="faq-module-contents">What is included in a module?</h2>

    <p>Each module contains everything you need to walk students through a lesson: the data, instructor background, slides with a guide to use, student handouts, assignments, assessment tools, enrichment options, and references for additional resources.</p>


    <h2 id="faq-adapting-modules">What if I need to adapt the module to my course?</h2>

    <p>Go ahead. The modules have a liberal <a target="_blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">reuse license</a>, and educators are free to use the entire module or adapt it to meet the needs of their specific class.</p>


    <h2 id="faq-similar-resources">Where can I find similar resources?</h2>

    <p>Here are a few other data-oriented classroom resources that we are aware of. Please let us know if there are others that you think should be included on this list. [TODO: list other data-oriented classroom resources here]</p>

    <h2 id="faq-collaborate-with-dryadlab">I am a researcher and/or educator. How can I collaborate with DryadLab to develop a new module either based on my own data, or to fill a particular curricular need?</h2>

    <p>We encourage researchers to consider developing a DryadLab module in order to achieve broader impact in their research programme. Collaborative work with Dryad would typically be funded by the researcherâ€™s institution or grant. We also welcome expressions of interest from expert educators who are interested in developing a DryadLab module to meet a specific curriculum need. Existing educational modules may be submitted to be considered for inclusion in the DryadLab collection, but will only be accepted after (typically extensive) review and revision.  Please <a href="/feedback" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you wish to contribute to the collection in any way.</p>


    <h2 id="faq-testing-and-feedback">Have these been tested in the classroom?  What if I use your modules and have feedback or suggestions?</h2>

    <p>Our first modules are being tested in collaboration with a faculty mentoring network organized by <a href="https://qubeshub.org/groups/dryadlabnetwork/" target="_blank">QUBES</a>. If you have additional feedback from using these, whether it be a testimonial or a suggestion to help us improve a module, <a href="/feedback" target="_blank">we would love to hear from you</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="faq-stay-informed">How do I stay informed about DryadLab?</h2>

    <p>Please sign up for <a href="https://lists.nescent.org/mailman/listinfo/dryad-users" target="_blank">our low volume mailing list</a>. You can also follow Dryad on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/datadryad" target="_blank">@datadryad</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="faq-contact">Who do I contact to give feedback on the website?</h2>

    <p>Please send your suggestions <a target="_blank" href="/feedback">here</a></p>
