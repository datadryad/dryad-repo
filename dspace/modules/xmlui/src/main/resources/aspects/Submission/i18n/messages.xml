         The format used by all keys is as follows

         xmlui.<Aspect>.<Java Class>.<name>

         There are a few exceptions to this nameing format,
         1) Some general keys are in the xmlui.general namespace
            because they are used very frequently.
         2) Some general keys which are specific to a particular aspect
            may be found at xmlui.<Aspect> without specifiying a
            particular java class.
