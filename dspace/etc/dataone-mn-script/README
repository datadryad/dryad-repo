=======================

This directory contains a python script for validating Dryad metadata documents exposed by the DataONE MN API.

Dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file, which is the standard format for installing python packages with pip.

The script also uses the xmllint command-line tool, and assumes it is located at /usr/bin/xmllint

The script is configured to scrape http://dev.datadryad.org/mn/ for objects and output the validation results to validation.csv
