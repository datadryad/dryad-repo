Should you need to modify your data package while it is in review, you may access it at https://datadryad.org/submissions.
The actions you can perform while a submission is in review are limited. Dryad does not allow files to be deleted 
while an article is under review. We only allow additions during this time. This restriction ensures that all reviewers
see the files that were originally submitted.
</p>
<p>
To add new or corrected files, log into your Dryad account and click on the "My Submissions" link in the menu. 
Select the appropriate data package. At the bottom of the page for this package, you will see a button 
"Add new data file". After you have finished adding data files, please email help@datadryad.org to indicate which files
should be retained during the final curation process. Once your article has been accepted for publication, the Dryad 
curators will remove duplicate or superseded files.

Many thanks!<br>
